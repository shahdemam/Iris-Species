Iris Flower Classification Project ðŸŒ¸

This project focuses on classifying Iris flower species using machine learning techniques. The Iris dataset is a classic dataset in pattern recognition and is widely used for benchmarking classification algorithms.

ðŸ”§ What I Did:
Performed data preprocessing: handled missing values, normalized features, and encoded labels.

Built and evaluated three machine learning classification models:

Naive Bayes

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

Logistic Regression

Compared model performances using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report.

Visualized data distributions and model predictions for better understanding.
